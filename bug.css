The CSS code is using a vendor prefix that is no longer supported by modern browsers. For example, using `-webkit-` or `-moz-` prefixes for properties that have standard equivalents can lead to unexpected styling issues in browsers that no longer support those prefixes.  This can result in the styles not being applied correctly or not being applied at all, depending on the browser.
