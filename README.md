This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked CSS bug: the use of outdated vendor prefixes.  Many modern CSS properties once required vendor prefixes for support in older versions of browsers like WebKit (Safari) or Gecko (Firefox). Now, these prefixes are often unnecessary and can lead to rendering inconsistencies or outright failure to apply styles in more modern browsers. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code. The corrected version is in `bugSolution.css`. The key takeaway is to always check for standard, unprefixed CSS properties before resorting to vendor prefixes.  Keeping your CSS up to date will guarantee better cross-browser compatibility and cleaner code.
